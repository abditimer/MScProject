# MScProject

Application for Civil Engineers to visualise important data, through the use of intelligent automation.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

No prerequisites, except for knowledge in running a Java file.

### Installing

No installation required. Run the "MainApp" Class found in the 'Main' package. Once this is run, the application should run itself.

## Running the tests

I have included a package that details the unit testing (done using JUnit tests), that can be found in the package 'tests' package.

### Break down into end to end tests

The following Tests are included:

  1. Advanced Analysis Test - Tests the advanced analysis feature of the application, that provides the user with helpful information.
  2. ArrayList Creator Test - tests the ability to create specific arrayList needed for one of my main classes.
  3. CSVRead Data Detected Test - This tests the CSVReading capabilities. 
  4. CSVReader Test - This tests the various tasks with reading a CSV file.
  5. Data Detector Test - This tests the ability of my classes to detect certain data types.
  6. Data Format FX Test - This tests the ability to format the data accordingly.
  7. Easting Northing Convertor Test - Tests the ability to convert from lat/long to east/northings.
  8. Map Creator Test - tests the ability to create a Map.
